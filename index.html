            <h2>X Faces Privacy Complaints in the EU</h2>
            <p>
                X, the social media platform owned by Elon Musk, has been targeted with a series of privacy complaints 
                after it helped itself to the data of users in the European Union for training AI models without asking 
                people’s consent.
                <br><br>
                The nine complaints against X, which have been filed with data protection authorities in Austria, Belgium, 
                France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain, accuse it of failing this step by 
                processing Europeans’ posts to train AI without obtaining their consent.

            <h2>Made by Google 2024 Event Recap</h2>
            <p>
                The Made by Google 2024 event has come to an end, and after a busy rumor mill preceding the event, 
                we have rounded up the announcements and reveals from Google’s biggest hardware event of the year.
                <br><br>
                Notably, this year’s event is preceding Apple’s typical September iPhone reveal, with a focus on AI 
                that anyone watching any tech event in the past couple years is well familiar with.

            <h2>Building a Software Business: The Right Way?</h2>
            <p>
                What is the right way to build a software business?
                <br><br>
                Many startup advisers say that B2B software should solve one pain point, gain customers, then add features 
                as their company grows. Serial founder Parker Conrad, currently the founder and CEO of Rippling, an HR software 
                startup valued at $13.5 billion in April, thinks that’s the wrong way to do it.
                <br><br>

            <h2>The Latest Generative Models in Film and TV</h2>
            <p>
                The latest generative models make for great demos, but are they really about to change how people make movies and TV?
                <br><br>
                Not in the short term, according to filmmaking and VFX experts. But in the long term, the changes could be literally beyond our imagining.
