    <h2>X begins rolling out support for passkeys on Android</h2> 
    <p>X, formerly known as Twitter, has announced that it's rolling out support for passkeys on Android. The launch comes as the social network rolled out support for passkeys to all iOS users back in April.</p> 
    <p>Passkey logins make it harder for bad actors to remotely access your accounts since they would also need physical access to your phone. Unlike standard logins, passkeys use Face ID or Touch ID, a PIN, or a physical security authentication key to validate logins.</p> 
    <p>Passkeys are a relatively new technology that removes the need to rely on username and password combinations, which can be susceptible to phishing and other issues.</p> 
    <p>X is one of many tech companies to introduce passkey support in the past year or so. Other big names that have done so include Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, PayPal, TikTok, WhatsApp and GitHub.</p> 
    <p>On X, the addition of passkey support could help users who previously relied on SMS 2FA, an option that X removed for free users last year.</p> 
    <p>You can enable passkeys on X by logging into the app, clicking "Your account" in the navigation bar and then selecting "Settings and privacy." Next, you need to click "Security and account access," and then "Security." Under the "Additional password protection" options select "Passkey." Click the "Add a passkey" option and then follow the prompts to enable the feature.</p>
